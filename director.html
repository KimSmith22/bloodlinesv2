        <h2 class="text-center">ABOUT JOHN BOROWSKI</h2>
        <img class="wrap img-responsive headshot" src="img/HEADSHOT_JOHN_BEST2-GUCCI._CROP.jpg" alt="bloodlines">
        <p>
          John Borowski is an award winning independent filmmaker and author whose film works have garnered international acclaim and are distributed
          internationally on DVD, television, and internet streaming. Borowski’s “historical horror” trilogy of documentary films focusses on late
          nineteenth and early twentieth century serial killers.
        </p>
        <p>
          After receiving his B.A. from Columbia College Chicago’s film program, Borowski freelanced as an editor and cinematographer. Director Willy Laszlo
          chose Borowski to edit every headlining film for the Chicago Short Comedy Film and Video Festival from 1999 to 2003. In 2004, Borowski’s independently
          produced first film, “H.H. Holmes: America’s First Serial Killer,” was distributed on DVD in North America by Facets Video. For the voice of the
          narrator, Borowski chose Tony Jay, the voice of villain Judge Claude Frollo in Disney’s “Hunchback of Notre Dame.” Holmes was awarded with numerous
          awards including Best Director of The Midwest independent Film Festival and Best Documentary for Screamfest and was also broadcast on Court TV Canada.
        </p>
        <p>
          Holmes received an unprecedented amount of press, being covered by television (CBS News, Wild Chicago), print (Variety, LA Weekly, Chicago Sun-Times,
          Ain't It Cool News, Philadelphia Weekly, Chicago Magazine), and radio (Mancow Show, Deadpit Radio). The historical interest in Holmes was reflected
          in the lectures Borowski delivered to The Chicago Historical Society, Indiana State University, and St. Xavier University. “The Strange Case of
          Dr. H.H. Holmes,” is an illustrated book published by Borowski containing three primary source books about the Holmes case and complete confession.
          H.H. Holmes has been distributed to over a dozen countries worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          After disappearing for over 25 years, Dennis Rader, the BTK Murderer, resurfaced in 2004 after sending letters to the Wichita Press. The Wichita Police
          Department contacted Borowski to aid in their investigation by subpoenaing the names of people in Wichita who ordered the Holmes DVD. BTK was familiar
          with other serial killers and had mentioned H.H. Holmes in his writings, therefore the authorities were covering all bases by investigating any potential
          suspects who may have purchased a Holmes DVD. Dennis Rader, the BTK murderer was apprehended in February of 2005.
        </p>
        <p>
          Borowski relocated to Los Angeles in 2005 for four years where he produced his second film, “Albert Fish: In Sin He Found Salvation,” which has been called
          “one of the most disturbing films ever made.” For Fish, Borowski interviewed artist Joe Coleman and had a tour of his famous Odditorium in Brooklyn, NY.
          Also, in 2005, Borowski served as Associate Producer on the British television documentary production, “Murder Hotel.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Albert Fish was released on DVD in 2007 and the world premiere screening was held at the historic Vine Theater in Hollywood. At the New York Screening,
          Borowski met the Italian distributor for Gargoyle Video who agreed to distribute Fish in Italy. The BTK murder case resurfaced again in Borowski’s life
          when he became assistant editor on the documentary film, “I Survived BTK.” Borowski’s worldwide filmmaking appeal burgeoned with screenings of HH Holmes
          and Albert Fish in foreign countries such as Greece, Denmark, United Kingdom, Italy, and Canada. Holmes and Fish were also featured in the Australian book,
          “Celluloid Serial Killers” (2007).
        <p>
          Borowski relocated back to Chicago in 2009. Always embracing cutting edge technology, Borowski ensured his films were available to the internet/streaming
          audience. In 2009, Netflix began streaming Holmes and Fish. Releases of the films on Itunes, Amazon, and Hulu followed immediately after. Borowski directed
          his first ever book trailer for John Everson’s, “The 13th,” published by Leisure Books.
        </p>
        <p>
          The worldwide appeal of Borowski’s fanbase was reflected in numerous projects in 2010 including being featured in the books, “Murderabilia and True Crime
          Collecting” (Published in the U.K.), and “The Documentary Moviemaking Course.” Also, in 2010, Borowski was the associate producer on Chilean filmmaker
          Patricio Valladares’ feature film, “Toro Loco.”
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2011, Borowski attended The Crime Scene, a true crime performance event, where he received a letter from serial killer Keith Jesperson asking Borowski
          to create a film on his life. The Swedish Band, Sparzanza, utilized Tony Jay’s narration audio from Albert Fish for their song, Mr Fish. Borowski also directed
          the music video of Mr. Fish, which many Sparzanza fans have called their favorite music video.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Carl Panzram: The Spirit of Hatred and Vengeance,” Borowski’s third feature documentary film, was released on DVD October 23, 2012 and is now also available for
          streaming worldwide at the official film site. The film features John DiMaggio (Bender from Fox’s Futurama) as the voice of lifelong criminal and murderer Carl
          Panzram. For the film, Borowski underwent a process of unprecedented research which included filming at the maximum-security prisons of Leavenworth Penitentiary
          and Clinton Correction Facility as well as filming Panzram’s handwritten autobiographical papers at San Diego State University. Panzram was awarded the director's
          choice award at the 2012 Chicago Horror Film Festival.
        </p>
        <p>
          The popularity of Borowski’s films reached an all-time high in 2012. In April and October, HH Holmes aired on PBS and Borowski was the special guest on PBS' pledge
          drive. Bojan Pandža, Serbian author and film critic had this to say: "There are four horsemen of the Apocalypse, Herzog, Eroll, Les Blank and John Borowski.
          HONESTLY!!!"
          <br>
          In 2013, Borowski's films were screened in Paris France, he was featured in Psychology Today, U.K.'s Bizarre Magazine, interviewed for the Travel Channel show
          Monumental Mysteries, served as an official judge in the documentary category for the Housecore Horror Film Festival, completed “Mime Time” a short film entered
          into the ABC's of Death 2 competition and completed his fourth feature documentary film, “Serial Killer Culture,” released in 2014.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2016, Borowski released “The Ed Gein File,” a book containing documents from the Gein case. Serial Killer Culture TV was released in March of 2017 as a follow up
          to the successful film, “Serial Killer Culture. Dahmer's Confession,” Borowski's fourth book, was released in October of 2017. In 2018 Borowski releases his fifth
          feature documentary film, “Bloodlines: The Art and Life of Vincent Castiglia.” Borowski is currently busy writing several feature narrative film screenplays, writing
          his next book, “Panzram at Leavenworth,” producing the second season of SKCTV and producing his next serial killer biography documentary film, “Jesse Pomeroy: The
          Boston Boy Fiend.”
        </p>
        <p>Borowski currently resides in his hometown of Chicago.</p>
