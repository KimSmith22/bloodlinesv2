              <h4>
                  How did the film come about?
              </h4>
              <p>
                  Vincent and I were friends on Facebook as we admired each other’s art. Vincent posted on Facebook asking if others would
                  like to see him in a reality show. Many people responded favorably. I did not. I mentioned to Vincent that his appearance
                  on a reality show would most likely lessen the impact of his art and ultimately make him look like a fool as reality shows
                  are scripted and their main goal is to cause artificial conflicts to appease the viewers. I also mentioned to Vincent that
                  he really should have a feature documentary film produced on his art and life that would stand the test of time as a
                  reality show would be forgotten in a year or so. Vincent asked me if I would be interested in creating a film based on his
                  art and life and I accepted.
              </p>
              <h4>
                  How was the film funded?
              </h4>
              <p>
                  To fund the film, I ran a Kickstarter campaign. The campaign had a rocky beginning. When I shared the link to the film’s
                  fundraiser on Facebook, someone took offense to something about the film and reported it negatively to Facebook, which
                  then blocked all links to the Kickstarter fundraiser. I could not even message the link to the fundraiser to others on
                  Facebook. I was infuriated. Never taking no for an answer, I traveled to Facebook’s office in Chicago, where I live.
                  Once I arrived, I found that the elevator did not reach their floor, so I took a service elevator to the Facebook office,
                  knocked on their door and was buzzed in. I met a kind young man and I pleaded my case to him and he stated that it is an
                  autoboot problem. I asked if he could help clear it up and that the fundraiser depends on the interaction with Facebook
                  and that this is an important film about an American artist created by another American artist and the fundraiser should
                  not be blocked. Several hours later, the block was lifted.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>What is the film format and length? </h4>
              <p>
                  The film is HD, 1920x1080, color and Runs 91 minutes.
              </p>
              <h4>
                How long did it take to complete the film?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Development for the Kickstarter Fundraiser began in the summer of 2014. In February of 2015, the Kickstarter fundraiser
                launched. Filming began in 2015. The final edit of the film was completed in February of 2018.
              </p>
              <h4>
                What locations were traveled to for filming?
              </h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>New York, NY</li>
                  <li>Chicago, IL</li>
                  <li>Los Angeles, CA</li>
                  <li>Baton Rouge, LA</li>
                  <li>Gruyeres & Zurich, Switzerland</li>
                </ul>
              <h4>Why is the film dedicated to H.R. Giger?</h4>
              <p>
                Ever since Borowski saw the movie Alien at the age of seven, he has always admired the amazing artwork of Giger.
                Vincent’s first gallery showing was at the Giger museum in Switzerland.
              </p>
              <h4>John Borowski is listed as producer, director, editor, and cinematographer. Did he actually fill ALL those roles?</h4>
              <p>
                Yes, John Borowski is multitalented and usually a one-man band. Realizing that his films are created on an ultra-low budget,
                Borowski fills many roles and wears many hats during the productions of his films. Borowski even designed the film’s poster!
              </p>
              <h4>How many vials of Borowski’s blood were drawn for his portrait created in his own blood?</h4>
              <p>
                Borowski gave twelve vials of his blood towards the completion of his portrait. All in one sitting!
              </p>
              <h4>Some of the footage is quite gruesome, especially the plastic surgery. Why was this footage included in graphic detail?</h4>
              <p>
                One of Vincent’s collector’s is a plastic surgeon, so Borowski intended to film him in his occupation. There are numerous
                shots of a plastic surgery included because Borowski felt the need to create an atmosphere, drawing the audience members
                into the surreal world of the film and Vincent’s paintings.
