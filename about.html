        <h2 class="text-center">ABOUT THE FILM</h2>
      <p>
        Vincent and I were friends on Facebook as we admired each other’s art. Vincent posted on Facebook asking if others would
        like to see him in a reality show. Many people responded favorably. I did not. I mentioned to Vincent that his appearance
        on a reality show would most likely lessen the impact of his art and ultimately make him look like a fool as reality shows
        are scripted and their main goal is to cause artificial conflicts to appease the viewers. I also mentioned to Vincent that
        he really should have a feature documentary film produced on his art and life that would stand the test of time as a
        reality show would be forgotten in a year or so. Vincent asked me if I would be interested in creating a film based on his
        art and life and I accepted.
      </p>

      <p>
        To fund the film, I ran a Kickstarter campaign. The campaign had a rocky beginning. When I shared the link to the film’s
        fundraiser on Facebook, someone took offense to something about the film and reported it negatively to Facebook, which
        then blocked all links to the Kickstarter fundraiser. I could not even message the link to the fundraiser to others on
        Facebook. I was infuriated. Never taking no for an answer, I traveled to Facebook’s office in Chicago, where I live.
        Once I arrived, I found that the elevator did not reach their floor, so I took a service elevator to the Facebook office,
        knocked on their door and was buzzed in. I met a kind young man and I pleaded my case to him and he stated that it is an
        autoboot problem. I asked if he could help clear it up and that the fundraiser depends on the interaction with Facebook
        and that this is an important film about an American artist created by another American artist and the fundraiser should
        not be blocked. Several hours later, the block was lifted.
